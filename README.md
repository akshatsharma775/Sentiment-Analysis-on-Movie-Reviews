# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically determine the sentiment of a movie review as either positive, negative, or neutral based on the textual content of the review.
Background:

Movie reviews, which are typically found on platforms like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or social media, provide valuable feedback from audiences. Understanding whether a review conveys positive or negative sentiment is critical for movie studios, platforms, and potential viewers in assessing the success or appeal of a movie.
Problem Description:

Given a dataset of movie reviews, the task is to analyze the textual content and classify each review as either positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The model should be able to:

    Understand contextual clues and linguistic nuances in the reviews.
    Deal with a variety of writing styles and word choices.
    Handle challenges such as sarcasm, colloquial language, and short or ambiguous statements.

Objectives:

    Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset, which may involve tokenization, removing stop words, handling misspellings, and dealing with special characters or emojis.
    Feature Extraction: Convert the textual data into a format suitable for machine learning. This might involve methods like Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
    Model Selection: Train a classification model using algorithms like:
        Logistic Regression
        Naive Bayes
        Support Vector Machines (SVM)
        Random Forest
        Deep learning approaches like LSTM, BERT, or GRU for handling sequential text data.
    Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning should also be conducted to optimize model performance.
    Deployment: Optionally, deploy the trained model in a real-world environment, where users can input new reviews and get instant sentiment analysis results.
